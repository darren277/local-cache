# local-cache

## About

This project is a caching layer for locally running servers and web applications.

I have several local web applications I serve for myself for things like inventory management, information dashboards, etc. I wanted a way to cache some of the more frequently accessed responses from these applications so that I could serve them faster and not have to wait for the application to generate the response every time I visited the page.
